Predicting Passenger Door Choice in Subway Transportation
This project aims to simulate and analyze how passengers choose between subway train doors based on various attributes like distance, crowding, and accessibility. By using a Stated Choice Experiment (SCE) built in Streamlit, the goal is to gather behavioral insights that can help reduce dwell times and optimize boarding strategies in public transit systems.

Project Objectives
- Build a choice-based web survey using Streamlit
- Collect user responses on door selection tasks
- Integrate data collection with Google Sheets
- Analyze how factors like mobility, obstacles, and transfer requirements influence decision-making
- Draw insights to inform better transit design or simulation models


Streamlit App
- Multi-page layout (demographics → comprehension → 12 choice tasks)
- Visual comparison of Door A vs. Door B with varying attributes
- Google Sheets integration to store:
  - Door choice responses
  - Demographic data
  - Comprehension checks

Data Collected
- 12 discrete choice tasks per participant
- Attributes include:
    - Distance to door (D2D)
    - Obstacle presence (O)
    - Crowding at door (CD), on platform (CP)
    - Transfer time and requirement
- Demographic factors: age, gender, mobility, travel frequency
